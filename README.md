# TDT4215: Recommender Systems (Group 7)

## TASK: Develop a news recommender system

## DATA: user data from the local digital newspaper (January - March)

- 1,000 most active users
- 9 attributes (userID, title)

## Examples

- CF --> Explicit Matrix Factorization (MF)
- Content-based --> TF-IDF + Cosine similarity

## EVALUATION

1. Recall (hit rate) --> positive instances that are correctly predicted
2. CTR (Click- through rate) --> recommendations clicked over total rec
3. ARHR (average reciprocal hit rate)
4. MSE

## REPORT (max 15 pages)

1. Motivation
2. overview of existing news recommender algorithms and approaches
3. evaluation results
4. conclusion

## EVALUATION: report + presentation + performance evaluation

## STEPS

1. train test split --> scikit-learn
2. Implement a Collaborative filtering RS
3. Implement a Content-based RS
4. Merge them and build a Hybrid RS
5. Evaluation Recall, ARHR)

## TODO now

1. Merge both data sets
2. Create a long list of all events, sorted by timestamp (keep this to perform analyses on the complete data set, such as TF*IDF)
3. Split 80/20 train/test
4. Extract individual users from both train and test into one file each
